Encoder for turret, dealing with gap in chain
When to run ballistics
    - 

Steps for Shooting Ball
1. Determine where we are:  get vision values of vision target, angle of robot from gyro, time permitting field mapper with encoders
2. Lock turret to target:  rotate platform to appropriate position without overrotating (gap + limit switch)
3. Calculate firing solution (speed and angle):  run ballistics program
4. Adjust system to firing solution:  hood and PID-controlled speed of flywheel
5. Wait for system configuration confirmation:  check PID values
6. Activate lower wheel bar and fire
(7.?) Wait for wheel speed to recover to optimal value, return to 5   

Manual override for turret and hood

Option 1:
1-3 should be continuous, locking turret to target and calculating firing solutions, but not adjusting system
4-7 button activated

Option 2:
1 is continuous, alongside a turret loop that locks to 0 degrees (pointing towards target)
2-7 run when button is pressed
